### About Voronoi Treemaps
The first section provides some background information, talking about what voronoi tree maps are and provides an example of a one. Additionally, in this section we provided an example of a default D3 rectangular treemap, so users can compare between the two. 

### Creating a Simple Voronoi Treemap with D3.js
The second section of the provides descriptions on how to create your own simple voronoi treemap with D3.js. In this section we provided a series of steps with detailed explanations and code examples, to help you get started. At the end of this section there is an Additional Info Section, which gives a basic overview of some of the major functions and algorithms that goes into making a voronoi treemap.

### Voronoi General Background Processes
The third section provides information on the general background processes of voronoi treemap. In this section we take a deeper dive into what is actually going on when a voronoi treemap is being produced. We provided some steps and sample screenshots of what is actually going on. Additionally, we provided a website and a video for those we want to look into it more.

### The d3-voronoi-treemap.js library
The final section provides information on the library with a link and some of the general code from it. Moreover, we provided explanations on two of the main functions that goes into developing and generating the voronoi treemap.
